## Bivariate Exploration

### LoanStatus vs BorrowerState

The state have more loan are **CA**, **FL**, **IL**, **NY** and **TX**.
All of them have more current loan, then completed loan.

This is same as our discovery in LoanStatus and BorrowerState.
Completed CA loan amount is larger than other current loan in other state.
Beside that we can not see clear relationship between these two.


### LoanStatus vs BorrowerAPR

**Completed** loan status has lowest borrowerAPR. **PastDue(91-120 days)** has the highest borrowerAPR.
If we group past due together, past due still has the highest borrowerAPR.
Completed loan status has the largest range of borrowerAPR. Canceled loan status has the narrowest range of borrowerAPR.


### LoanStatus vs BorrowerRate

**Completed** loan status has lowest borrower rate. **PastDue(91-120 days)** has the highest borrower rate, which is same as borrower rate.
If we group past due together, past due still has the highest borrower rate.
Defaulted loan status has the largest range of highest borrower rate. Canceled loan status has the narrowest range of borrower rate.


### LoanStatus vs EmploymentStatus

The largest amount of loan are belongs to **current+employed**.
Then is **full-time+completed**, **completed+employed**.


## LoanStatus vs EmploymentStatusDuration

**Current load status** has the largest employment status duration, **cancelled** has the lowest employment status duration.


## LoanStatus vs DebtToIncomeRatio**

**Cancelled** load status has the lowest debt to income ratio and **past due(16-30 days)** has the largest debt to income ratio.
If we group past due together, **past due** still has the largest debt to income ratio.


## LoanStatus vs MonthlyLoanPayment

**Cancelled** load status has the lowest monthly loan payment and **current** has the largest monthly loan payment.


## LoanStatus vs Investors

**Current** load status has fewest investors and **completed** load status has most investors.


## BorrowerAPR vs BorrowerState

The higher Borrower APR are from AR and AL and MS.
The lower Borrower APR are from ME and IA.

Among smaller BorrowerAPR  and larger BorrowerAPR, the highest and lowest states are different.
Among the larger Borrower APR, the highest is LA, lowest is ME.
Among the smaller Borrower APR, the highest is SD, lowest is VT.


## BorrowerAPR vs EmploymentStatus

The higher Borrower APR are from not employed.
The lower Borrower APR are from part-time.

Among the larger Borrower APR, the highest is not employed, lowest is unknown(not available).
Among the smaller Borrower APR, the highest is other status, lowest is full-time.

## BorrowerAPR vs EmploymentStatusDuration

There is a not clear obvious normal distribution between borrower APR and employment status duration.

We see no clear relationship between:
 - BorrowerAPR vs DebtToIncomeRatio
 - BorrowerAPR vs StatedMonthlyIncome
 - BorrowerAPR vs MonthlyLoanPayment
 - BorrowerAPR vs Investors

## BorrowerRate vs BorrowerState

In general, MD, MO, AL have higher borrower rate.
IA, ME have lower borrower rate.

MD, SD, ND have higher borrower rate among lower borrower rate.
AL, OR have lower borrower rate among lower borrower rate.

ND has higher borrower rate among higher borrower rate.
IA has lower borrower rate among lower borrower rate.


## BorrowerRate vs Investors

There is a right skewed relationship between BorrowerRate and investors.

AR has a higher borrower AR in defaulted load status.
AR and AL have a higher borrower AR in past due load status.
